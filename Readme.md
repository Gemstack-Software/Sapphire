# Sapphire 0.10.0

Sapphire is brand new solution for Web Development. It's working using 2 concepts: 
+ It's Framework - running website code: layouts and components written in Onyx Templating Language.
+ It's CMS - allowing to create store and modify data in Collections just like in database.

It will easily fit your needs because of built-in Plugins Manager System which allows extending Sapphire
via Plugins which can control all aspects of CMS and Framework.

## Installation
After installing on localhost, add folders "~trash" and "~temp" in resources folder locally, 
PHP version: 8.0.10

## Starting
```
cd public
php -S localhost:2000
```

## Reasons why Sapphire:
1. Admin Panel
Admin Panel is sacred thing for us in Sapphire. It was created for YOU. 
It provides best UX controlling your Application or Website via Amazing Predictable UI.

2. Sapphire framework structure
Firstly we need to say that Sapphire is BACK-END Framework.
All websites or applications in Sapphire are built using Layouts whose are main templates of website or application.
Layouts can use Components whose are supported by Sapphire Code API (built-in Fast Translating System, built-in Asset Management System, built-in Scoped Styles System). In Components you can obtain or manipulate data that you have collected in Collections.

3. Page Routing
Sapphire is built using simple concept - your website has pages which you want and you can stack them inside others.
Sapphire Page Routing system is very simple to use, but generally advanced tool which allow you to create Pages (e.g. Privacy Policy) route them (create url for them), add Layout which they will render, e voil√† - your brand new page is ready!

4. Built-in features
Sapphire provides a lot of built-in features like:
+ Asset Management
+ Website Translation System
+ Application Editor - components, layouts, styles (inside Admin Panel)
+ Scoped Styles for components.
+ Sapphire Code API - for easier developing components and layouts.
+ Users based on Roles and Permissions.
+ Plugin Management System

and a lot of other features (like Analytics) from our or community Plugins.

5. Better Software 
Sapphire is not the Fastest One in the world, but one of our concepts is to make Software Better. In todays world it don't really matters for website or medium-size/budget application to upload `scripts.js` or render "Hello world" 10ms faster. We of course try to maximize Performance of Sapphire but not always in cost of UX or Functionality of Sapphire.

6. Crystal Framework
Sapphire is built on Concept we call "Crystal Framework" which you won't find in other Frameworks or CMS.
Crystal Framework is concept of making framework (framework has admin panel to manage runtime or application and it contain CMS).
It's called Crystal Framework because structure is simple but very hard to broke (like in case of crystals) and it's easy (clear/transparent) to use.

7. Something innovative
Sapphire is just Something New, and you won't find any other frameworks or content management systems like this.
It has very big potential to improve Web Development.

8. It's free.
Our Projects are open-source because we want to Share our ideas to improve the web.
If you enjoy our work always and you want to help us you can donate us. 

## Project is currently under beta development 
Few things are missing (Custom APIs, Custom Roles, JavaScript management). But in next months we will develop them in Sapphire Ecosystem.
They will grow up to became Future of Web Development.

## Documentation
We're still creating full documentation and user guide for Sapphire. We want to share Documentation and Official Sapphire Website with you to end of 2023. 

## You want help us?
